RCPL signature (Resting-state functional Connectivity signature of Pain-related Learning)
==========================

# This readme is still under construction. More details come how to use the model on your data. If you have any question applying, contact with the developers.

# RCPL
You can read more about the training, validation, specificity test, model interpretation in our Communications Biology paper: [Kincses et al](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-024-06574-y). Check also the [preregistration](https://osf.io/b8znd/) for more detail.

For the preprocessing of the resting-state data, the [PUMI pipeline](https://github.com/pni-lab/PUMI) were used. The latest version of the pipeline also provides RCPL scores.
